# Super-Mario-Bros
This file system is a simulation of the original Super Mario Bros for the Nintendo Entertainment System. The game was written by myself and three of my classmates over the course of an entire semester as a project for a CSE course. 

The intention was to attempt to emulate the original game's physics and mechanics as closely as possible. Given our time constraints, only levels 1-1 and 1-4 are available, but the game also includes a second playable character in the form of Link. 

The game was written in C# using Visual Studio as an IDE and Monogame as a graphics engine. This was my first time using C#, this game engine, as well as coding in an Agile environment, which was the primary function of the class.
